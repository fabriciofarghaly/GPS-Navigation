    What bugs and conceptual difficulties did you encounter? How did you overcome them? What did you learn?
        - I ran into issues with a few things. Creating the nodes, Hashmap, and such was fairly easy, but something I struggle with is splitting up my code into chunks or different classes.
          I had issues with this in project 1 due to bad habit, but I feel like I was able to do better this time around. I initially had most of A* in my project 1 folder but decided on changing this for easier management/debugging

    Describe whatever help (if any) that you received. Donâ€™t include readings, lectures, and exercises, but do include any help from other sources, such as websites or people (including classmates and friends) and attribute them by name.
        - Used a few different websites to try to better understand a*
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm (just the wikipedia)
        - https://stackabuse.com/graphs-in-java-a-star-algorithm/
        - No code was ripped from websites, rather used for trying to get started and give my self a slightly more solid foundation

    Describe any serious problems you encountered while writing the program.
        - I had an issue for a while where when I was calculating h, g and f for children nodes, it took me a long time to realize I had accidentally been doing with only the origin node
          which led to very frustrating back and forths changing different aspects of my code
        - I also had big problems with using for loops and actually learned how to use enhanced for loops specifically for this. After understanding their utility
          the project came together more easily from there

    Did you do any of the challenges (see below)? If so, explain what you did.
    List any other feedback you have. Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
    Was enjoyable and interesting
